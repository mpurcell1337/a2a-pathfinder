## Executive Summary

AI art creation involves the use of algorithms and machine learning to generate art. The process requires deep learning models for training the AI, a data set of art for learning, and a platform for delivery and interaction with users. The AI art creation process has significant potential, but it also presents certain challenges such as copyright issues and the question of originality in art.

## Detailed Analysis

### AI Art Creation Process
AI art creation involves the use of artificial intelligence to generate art. This often involves the use of deep learning, a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with several layers (deep networks) to analyze various factors and produce outputs.

One popular technique is the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where two AI models work in tandem to create art. One AI, the generator, creates images, while the second AI, the discriminator, evaluates the images based on its training from a data set of real images. The generator learns from the feedback and improves the outputs.

A key component of this process is a large dataset of art for the AI to learn from. This can include various art styles, periods, and mediums. The AI needs to analyze and understand the patterns, styles, and techniques used in these works to generate similar art.

### Challenges and Potential Solutions
There are several challenges to consider when creating an AI Art Company. One significant challenge is the issue of copyright and intellectual property rights. If an AI uses existing works of art to learn and create new works, who owns the rights to these new creations? This is an ongoing legal debate.

Another challenge is the question of originality and human touch in art. Some critics argue that AI-generated art lacks the creativity and emotion of human-created art. However, others argue that AI can create unique and unpredictable pieces that expand the realm of art.
