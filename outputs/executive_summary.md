# Executive Summary

The plan to establish an AI Art Company involves a blend of creative direction, technological implementation, and business strategy. The AI Art Company will leverage artificial intelligence to generate a vast amount of art, capitalizing on the increasing interest in AI-produced art.

## Creative Direction

Our AI Art Company's creative direction is fundamental, guiding the AI's training and impacting the aesthetic and emotional resonance of the generated art. We should establish our creative direction based on market trends, target audiences, and the unique capabilities of AI art. Monitoring the AI's output and adjusting the training process will be crucial to ensure the art remains unique and original.

## AI Art Creation Process

We will use deep learning models and a comprehensive dataset of art for our AI to learn from. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a popular method for AI art creation, with one AI model generating images and another evaluating these images based on a dataset of real art. Challenges include copyright issues and the question of originality in art, and we should strive to be transparent about our AI art creation process.

## Business Model

Our AI Art Company will have a mixed business model that combines direct sales, subscriptions, commissioned art, and licensing. This approach will allow us to diversify our revenue streams and cater to different customer preferences. We must manage potential legal and copyright issues related to AI-generated art.

# Recommendations
