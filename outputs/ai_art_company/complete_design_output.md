### Delegation Planning
Given the hybrid nature of this task, we'll need a combination of creative and business agents. I will allocate the tasks as follows:

1. **AI Creative Agent 1**: Define the creative direction. Determine the styles of art that will be popular in the market, the demographics we should target, and how we can ensure diversity in our art generation.

2. **AI Business Agent 1**: Develop the business model. Analyze potential revenue streams, set pricing strategies, and identify key operational costs.

3. **AI Business Agent 2**: Design the operational infrastructure. Identify the tools and systems we'll need to generate and distribute art at scale, and determine how we'll manage quality control.

4. **AI Business Agent 3**: Create the marketing strategy. Identify how we'll promote our art and attract customers, including key marketing channels and tactics.

5. **AI Business Agent 4**: Conduct a competitive analysis. Identify key competitors in the AI art space, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and recommend how we can differentiate ourselves.

### Monitoring and Creative Oversight
During the task execution, I'll track the progress of each agent, ensuring they are aligned with the overall business goal and addressing their designated areas effectively. I will make necessary adjustments based on their findings and the evolving market trends in the AI art space.

### Synthesis and Final Delivery
Once the agents have completed their tasks, I'll integrate their findings into a comprehensive, strategic business plan. This plan will provide actionable insights on the creative direction, business model, operational infrastructure, marketing strategy, and competitive landscape. This synthesis will be the final stage, ensuring the insights from each agent are woven together into a cohesive plan. 

We will now proceed to the execution phase.
